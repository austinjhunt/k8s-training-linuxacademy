# Probes
allow you to customize how k8s determines status of your containers. Probes can run commands in your containers or use HTTP requests.
## Liveness probes
Define your own criteria for determining if a pod is healthy
## Readiness probes
Define your own criteria for determining if container is ready to service requests. Until it is ready, it will not take requests.
