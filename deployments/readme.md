# Deployments
Deployments provide a way to declaratively manage a dynamic set of replica pods. 
(SIMILAR TO DOCKER SWARM)
They provide powerful functionality like scaling and rolling updates. 


A deployment defines a DESIRED STATE for replica pods. The cluster will constantly work to maintain that desired state.
In doing so, it will create, remove, and modify the replica pods accordingly.
